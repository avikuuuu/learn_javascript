# JavaScript Array and Object Basics

This repository contains JavaScript code snippets that cover essential concepts related to arrays and objects.

## Arrays

### Creating Arrays

Arrays are collections of values that can be accessed and manipulated. You can create arrays using various methods.

**Example:**

```javascript
const myArr = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const myHeors = ["shaktiman", "naagraj"];
const myArr2 = new Array(1, 2, 3, 4);
```

### Array Methods

JavaScript provides various methods for manipulating arrays, such as `push`, `pop`, `unshift`, `shift`, `includes`, `indexOf`, `join`, `slice`, and `splice`.

**Example:**

```javascript
myArr.push(6);
myArr.pop();
myArr.unshift(9);
myArr.shift();
console.log(myArr.includes(9));
console.log(myArr.indexOf(3));
const newArr = myArr.join();
```

### Array Manipulation

Arrays can be sliced or spliced to create new arrays or modify existing ones.

**Example:**

```javascript
const myn1 = myArr.slice(1, 3);
const myn2 = myArr.splice(1, 3);
```

## Objects

### Object Literal

Objects in JavaScript are key-value pairs. You can create objects using object literal notation.

**Example:**

```javascript
const JsUser = {
    name: "Hitesh",
    "full name": "Hitesh Choudhary",
    age: 18,
    location: "Jaipur",
    email: "hitesh@google.com",
    isLoggedIn: false,
    lastLoginDays: ["Monday", "Saturday"]
};
```

### Symbols and Object Methods

Symbols can be used as unique keys in objects. Objects can also have methods.

**Example:**

```javascript
const mysy = Symbol('key1');
JsUser[mysy] = "heyone";
JsUser.greeting = function () {
    console.log(`hey buddy ${JsUser["full name"]}`);
};

Object.freeze(JsUser); // Freezing the object to make it immutable
JsUser.email = 'tothe'; // Attempting to modify a property after freezing (won't have any effect)
console.log(JsUser);
console.log(JsUser.greeting()); // Note: The greeting method should be invoked, not just logged
```

## Array Concatenation

Arrays can be concatenated using various methods, such as `concat` or the spread operator `...`.

**Example:**

```javascript
let m2 = [7, 8, 9, 10, 5];
let m1 = [34, 56, 78, 23];
const de = m2.concat(m1);
let m3=[...m1,...m2]
console.log(de);
```

## Nested Arrays and Array Flattening

Arrays can contain nested arrays. The `flat` method is used to flatten nested arrays.

**Example:**

```javascript
const another_array = [1, 2, 3, [4, 5, 6], 7, [6, 7, [4, 5]]];
const real_another_array = another_array.flat(Infinity);
console.log(real_another_array);
```
